This article explains how to use SecuX to trade on Bitcoin.

## Installation
```bash npm
npm install @secux/app-btc
```

:::info

The package also support Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dash (DASH), DigiByte (DGB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Groestlcoin (GRS), Litecoin (LTC).

:::

## Supported Transaction
The following transaction types are supported on SecuX.

### Pay-to-Pubkey Hash (P2PKH)
Transactions that pay to a Bitcoin address contain P2PKH scripts that are resolved by sending the public key and a digital signature created by the corresponding private key.

The purpose of [BIP-32](https://github.com/Bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) path is `44` here.

> Available Bitcoin networks: BCH, DASH, DGB, DOGE, GRS, LTC.

### Pay-to-Script Hash (P2SH)
P2SH transactions were standardised in [BIP-16](https://github.com/Bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki) and introduced by Gavin Andresen, and it resulted in a new standard transaction type for the Bitcoin scripting system. 

The purpose of BIP-32 path is `49` here.

> Available Bitcoin networks: BCH, DGB, GRS, LTC.

### Pay-to-Witness-Pubkey-Hash (P2WPKH)
A P2WPKH transaction is similar to a P2PKH transaction in most ways; it still locks Bitcoin to the hash of a public key. The major difference is that P2WPKH uses [SegWit](https://github.com/Bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki).

The purpose of BIP-32 path is `84` here.

### Pay-to-TapRoot (P2TR)
A [P2TR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki) transaction allowing the owner or owners to choose how they would like to spend their money. This makes P2TR a significant improvement for the privacy of users.

The purpose of BIP-32 path is `86` here.

:::info

The cointype of BIP-32 path is `0` for Bitcoin, 145 (BCH), 5 (DASH), 20 (DGB), 3 (DOGE), 17 (GRS), 2 (LTC).

## Examples
The following examples will be demonstrated using usb.
```jsx
import { SecuxWebUSB } from "@secux/transport-webusb";
import { SecuxBTC } from "@secux/app-btc";

export async function useSecuX(callback) {
  const device = await SecuxWebUSB.Create();
  await device.Connect();

  await callback(device);

  await device.Disconnect();
}
```


### Generate Address
The following example is a React playground. Try modifying the BIP-32 path `m/84'/1'/0'/0/0` and play with it!
```jsx live
// We cannot import packages in live editor, please uncomment it for use.
// import { SecuxBTC, CoinType, ScriptType } from "@secux/app-btc";

function Example(props) {
  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');

  async function GenerateAddress(device) {
    // Modify BIP-32 path to play.
    const path = "m/84'/1'/0'/0/0";
    const buffer = SecuxBTC.prepareAddress(path);
    const response = await device.Exchange(buffer);
    const address = SecuxBTC.resolveAddress(response, path);

    setAddress(address);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => useSecuX(GenerateAddress)}/>
      <h2>{address}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Make Transaction
The following example is a React playground. Try modifying `<Receiving Address>` and play with it!
```jsx live
// We cannot import packages in live editor, please uncomment it for use.
// import { SecuxBTC, CoinType, ScriptType } from "@secux/app-btc";
// import mempoolJS from "@mempool/mempool.js";

function Example(props) {
  const [tranasction, setTransaction] = useState('');

  async function MakeTransaction(device) {
    // API https://mempool.space/testnet/docs/api/rest
    const { bitcoin: { addresses, fees, transactions } } = mempoolJS({
      hostname: "mempool.space",
      network: "testnet"
    });
    const fee = await fees.getFeesRecommended();

    // fetch UTXOs
    let inputs = [];
    const paths = ["m/44'/1'/0'/1/0", "m/44'/1'/0'/1/1", "m/49'/1'/0'/1/0"];
    for (const path of paths) {
      const publickey = await device.getPublickey(path);
      const address = SecuxBTC.addressConvert(publickey, path);
      const utxo = await addresses.getAddressTxsUtxo({ address });

      for (const unspent of utxo) {
        inputs.push({
          hash: unspent.txid,
          vout: unspent.vout,
          satoshis: unspent.value,
          path,
          publickey 
        });
      }
    }

    // signing by SecuX
    const { commands, rawTx } = SecuxBTC.prepareSign(
      inputs,
      {
        to: {
          address: "<Receiving Address>",
          satoshis: 1e4
        },
        utxo: {
          path: "m/84'/1'/0'/1/0",
          satoshis: 1,
          publickey: await device.getPublickey("m/84'/1'/0'/1/0")
        }
      },
      {
        // If you specify a feeRate, the transaction fee will be optimized.
        // The fee premium will be contributed to receiver,
        // or your change account if you specify utxo.
        feeRate: fee.fastestFee
      }
    );
    const responseList = [];
    for (const cmd of commands) {
      const response = await device.Exchange(cmd);
      responseList.push(response);
    }
    const signedTx = SecuxBTC.resolveTransaction(
      responseList, 
      {
        rawTx,
        publickeys: inputs.map(txIn => txIn.publickey),
      }
    );

    setTransaction(signedTx);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => useSecuX(MakeTransaction)}/>
      <h2>{tranasction}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```
